Original work of https://github.com/creotiv at https://github.com/creotiv/jquery-photowall.
I am maintaining my own copy for Photowall (http://drupal.org/project/photowall) Drupal module because latest version is causing some js break.

Download and put jquery-photowall folder into /sites/all/libraries folder. Photowall plugin file should be located at /sites/all/libraries/jquery-photowall/jquery-photowall.js.
